## ðŸ§© Component Documentation

The messaging system integrates multiple high-performance modules:

### Core Infrastructure
- **[Thread System](../libraries/thread_system/docs/)** - Lock-free concurrent processing framework
- **[Logger System](../libraries/logger_system/docs/)** - High-performance asynchronous logging
- **[Monitoring System](../libraries/monitoring_system/docs/)** - Real-time metrics and health monitoring

### Data & Communication Modules
- **[Container System](../libraries/container_system/README.md)** - Type-safe SIMD-optimized data containers
- **[Database System](../libraries/database_system/README.md)** - PostgreSQL integration with connection pooling
- **[Network System](../libraries/network_system/README.md)** - Asynchronous TCP messaging infrastructure

### Application Layer
- **[Sample Applications](../application_layer/samples/SAMPLES_README.md)** - 8 production-ready examples including chat server, IoT monitoring, and microservices orchestrator

## ðŸ“– Documentation Standards
