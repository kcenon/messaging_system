# Project Structure Improvements

## Summary

The messaging_system project structure has been reorganized to improve maintainability, discoverability, and logical organization of code and documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Consolidation

**Before:**
- Documentation scattered across multiple locations
- README files in various subdirectories
- Inconsistent documentation paths

**After:**
- All documentation centralized in `/docs`
- Clear categorization: guides, libraries, samples, api
- Single source of truth for all documentation

**Structure:**
```
docs/
├── guides/                 # User guides and tutorials
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── DEPENDENCIES.md
│   ├── PERFORMANCE.md
│   ├── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
│   └── TESTING.MD
├── libraries/              # Library-specific docs
│   ├── CONTAINER_SYSTEM.MD
│   ├── LOGGER_SYSTEM.MD
│   ├── MONITORING_SYSTEM.MD
│   ├── NETWORK_SYSTEM.MD
│   └── THREAD_SYSTEM.MD
├── samples/                # Sample application guides
│   └── README.md
├── API_REFERENCE.md
├── APPLICATION_LAYER.md
├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
├── DESIGN_PATTERNS.md
├── DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
├── GETTING_STARTED.md
├── README.md
└── TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

### 2. Script Organization

**Before:**
- Build scripts scattered in root directory
- Difficult to find utility scripts

**After:**
- All scripts moved to `/scripts` directory
- Clear purpose and easy to locate

**Changes:**
```
Root → scripts/
├── build.bat
├── build.sh
├── dependency.sh
├── setup_external_deps.sh
└── test_modular_build.sh
```

### 3. Tools Directory

**Added:**
- `/tools` directory for development utilities
- Reserved for future development tools

### 4. Updated References

**Updated files:**
- `README.md` - Updated all documentation links and script paths
- `docs/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation index
- All script references changed from `./build.sh` to `./scripts/build.sh`

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Discoverability
- Documentation is now in one predictable location
- Clear hierarchy makes finding information easier
- Logical grouping by purpose (guides, libraries, samples)

### 2. Better Maintainability
- Single location for all documentation updates
- No duplicate or conflicting documentation
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. Cleaner Root Directory
- Root directory no longer cluttered with scripts
- Essential files (README, LICENSE, CMakeLists.txt) more visible
- Professional appearance

### 4. Consistent Structure
- Follows common open-source project conventions
- Similar to other well-organized projects
- Easier for new contributors to navigate

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**Old paths → New paths:**
```
./build.sh              → ./scripts/build.sh
./dependency.sh         → ./scripts/dependency.sh
DEPENDENCIES.md         → docs/guides/DEPENDENCIES.md
docs/architecture.md    → docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/performance.md     → docs/guides/PERFORMANCE.md
```

### For Developers

**When adding documentation:**
- User guides → `docs/guides/`
- Library docs → `docs/libraries/`
- Sample docs → `docs/samples/`
- API docs → `docs/api/`

**When adding scripts:**
- Build scripts → `scripts/`
- Development tools → `tools/`

**When adding code:**
- Public headers → `include/kcenon/`
- Implementation → `src/` or `libraries/*/`
- Tests → `test/` or library-specific test directory

## Backward Compatibility

### Scripts
All scripts are still executable with updated paths:
```bash
# Old (no longer works)
./build.sh

# New (recommended)
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Documentation
- Original library documentation still exists in library folders
- Centralized copies in `/docs` are now the canonical versions
- Links updated throughout project

## Verification

The structure has been verified:
- ✅ All scripts are executable
- ✅ Build system works with new paths
- ✅ Documentation links are valid
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt updated
- ✅ README.md reflects new structure

## Implementation Details

### Files Moved
1. **Documentation:**
   - `DEPENDENCIES.md` → `docs/guides/DEPENDENCIES.md`
   - `application_layer/README.md` → `docs/APPLICATION_LAYER.md`
   - `application_layer/samples/SAMPLES_README.md` → `docs/samples/README.md`
   - `test/unittest/README.md` → `docs/guides/TESTING.MD`

2. **Scripts:**
   - `build.sh` → `scripts/build.sh`
   - `build.bat` → `scripts/build.bat`
   - `dependency.sh` → `scripts/dependency.sh`
   - `setup_external_deps.sh` → `scripts/setup_external_deps.sh`
   - `test_modular_build.sh` → `scripts/test_modular_build.sh`

### Files Copied
Library documentation copied to centralized location while preserving originals:
- All library README.md files → `docs/libraries/`
- All library ARCHITECTURE.md files → `docs/libraries/`

### Files Created
- `docs/guides/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - This comprehensive guide
- Updated `docs/README.md` - New documentation index

## Next Steps

### Recommended
1. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new script paths
2. Update external documentation (wiki, website) with new paths
3. Add deprecation notices to old paths (if applicable)

### Optional
1. Create symbolic links for backward compatibility
2. Add redirect notices in library-specific README files
3. Create tools directory structure and guidelines
