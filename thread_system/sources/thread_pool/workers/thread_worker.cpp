/**
 * @file thread_worker.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of worker thread for thread pool execution.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the thread_worker class, which represents
 * individual worker threads within a thread pool. Each worker thread continuously
 * processes jobs from a shared job queue until the thread pool is shut down.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Continuous job processing from shared queue
 * - Optional performance timing and logging
 * - Graceful shutdown handling
 * - Error propagation and logging
 * - Job queue association management
 * 
 * Worker Lifecycle:
 * 1. Worker is created and associated with a job queue
 * 2. Worker thread starts and enters continuous work loop
 * 3. Worker dequeues and executes jobs until queue is empty/stopped
 * 4. Worker logs execution results and timing information
 * 5. Worker shuts down gracefully when work is complete
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - Low latency job pickup (typically <1¬µs)
 * - Efficient queue polling with minimal CPU overhead
 * - Optional timing measurements for performance analysis

	 * - Sets descriptive name "thread_worker" for debugging and logging
	 * - Initializes timing flag for optional performance measurement
	 * - Job queue is not set initially (must be set before starting work)
	 * - Stores thread context for logging and monitoring
	 * 
	 * Performance Timing:
	 * - When enabled, measures execution time for each job
	 * - Uses high_resolution_clock for precise measurements
	 * - Minimal overhead when disabled (single boolean check)

	 * @brief Executes a single work cycle by processing one job from the queue.

	 * - Dequeues one job from the associated job queue
	 * - Validates job pointer before execution
	 * - Optionally measures execution timing for performance analysis
	 * - Associates job with queue for potential re-submission
	 * - Logs execution results with appropriate detail level

	 * Job Processing Workflow:
	 * 1. Validate job queue availability
	 * 2. Attempt to dequeue next job
	 * 3. Handle empty queue or stopped queue scenarios
	 * 4. Validate dequeued job pointer
	 * 5. Optionally record start time for measurement
	 * 6. Associate job with queue for context
	 * 7. Execute job's do_work() method
	 * 8. Handle execution errors with detailed logging
	 * 9. Log successful completion with timing info if enabled
	 * 
	 * Error Handling:
	 * - Missing job queue: Returns resource allocation error
	 * - Empty queue: Returns success if queue is stopped, error otherwise
	 * - Null job pointer: Returns job invalid error
	 * - Job execution failure: Returns execution failed error with details
	 * 
	 * Performance Measurements:
	 * - High-resolution timing when use_time_tag_ is enabled
	 * - Nanosecond precision for accurate profiling
	 * - Minimal overhead when timing is disabled
	 * 
	 * Logging Behavior:
	 * - Standard success message when timing is disabled
	 * - Timestamped success message when timing is enabled
	 * - Error details are propagated up the call stack
	 * 
	 * @return result_void indicating success or detailed error information
