	 * @class job_queue
	 * @brief A thread-safe job queue for managing and dispatching work items.
	 *
	 * The @c job_queue class provides a synchronized queue for storing and retrieving
	 * @c job objects (or derived classes). Multiple threads can safely enqueue and
	 * dequeue jobs, ensuring proper synchronization and preventing data races.
	 *
	 * This class inherits from @c std::enable_shared_from_this, which allows it to
	 * create @c std::shared_ptr instances referring to itself via @c get_ptr(). This
	 * is often useful when passing a @c job_queue pointer to jobs themselves or other
	 * components that need a safe, shared reference to the queue.
	 *
	 * ### Typical Usage
	 * 1. Create a @c job_queue instance, typically via @c std::make_shared.
	 * 2. Enqueue @c job objects (or derived types) using @c enqueue().
	 * 3. One or more worker threads repeatedly call @c dequeue() to retrieve jobs
	 *    and process them.
	 * 4. Call @c stop_waiting_dequeue() and possibly @c clear() to shut down the queue
	 *    gracefully when all jobs are done or when the system is stopping.
