/**
 * @file typed_lockfree_job_queue.cpp
 * @brief Explicit template instantiation for typed lock-free job queue.
 *
 * This file provides explicit template instantiation for the typed_lockfree_job_queue_t
 * template class with the job_types enumeration. This approach separates template
 * compilation from header inclusion, reducing compile times and binary size.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Explicit template instantiation for job_types enumeration
 * - Reduces template instantiation overhead in client code
 * - Centralizes template compilation for the typed job queue
 * - Maintains type safety while improving build performance
 * 
 * Template Instantiation Benefits:
 * - Faster compilation times for client code
 * - Reduced binary size through single instantiation
 * - Better error localization for template-related issues
 * - Cleaner separation of interface and implementation
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Client code includes only the header file
 * - Template implementation is pre-compiled in this unit
 * - Linker resolves template instantiation automatically
 * - Type safety maintained through template parameter validation

	 * 
	 * Instantiated Features:

	 * - Type-safe job categorization using job_types
	 * - Hazard pointer-based memory management
	 * - High-performance concurrent access
