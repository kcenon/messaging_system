## What is?
Normally, it is pretty hard to implement a TCP server and client with a proper thread system in the C++ language. To support newbie's desire to make their own TCP communication system, I planned its project.

So, it will contain several systems like below,
1. File log system
2. Concurrency control by the thread pool system
3. Serializable data packet container
4. Multi-session TCP server
5. TCP Client

And, it will provide functions like below,
1. Callback functions for each sequence such as connection, receiving data and receiving file
2. Send packet to specific target client
3. Send packet to all connected clients
4. Send files between main server and middle server
5. Packet compress and encrypt

## How to build
Before building this project, you have to download and build vcpkg(https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).
Secondly, should install libraries like below followed vcpkg install rule,

1. ASIO(https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/) or Boost(https://github.com/boostorg) library
2. fmt(https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library
3. cryptopp(https://www.cryptopp.com/) library
4. lz4(https://github.com/lz4/lz4) library

* If you want to use Boost library instead of Asio library, you have to remove 'ASIO_STANDALONE' on preprocessor definition on network library.

After all installations, you can build this project with Visual Studio 2019.
