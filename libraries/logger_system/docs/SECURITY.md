# Security Guide

This document outlines the current security posture of the logger_system and provides guidance for secure deployments.

## Threat Model (Scope)

- Sensitive data can accidentally enter logs (PII, credentials, API keys).
- Logs may be stored on shared disks or shipped over networks to central collectors.
- Attackers may read, tamper with, or replay logs if not adequately protected.

## Current Capabilities

- Sanitization: `log_sanitizer` and `sanitizing_filter` can redact common sensitive patterns (credit cards, SSN, email, IP, API keys, passwords) and support custom rules.
- Access control filter: Restrict logging based on file patterns, user context, and log levels.
- Encryption writer (demo): `encrypted_writer` wraps any writer and applies a simple XOR-based transformation.

## Important Limitations

- The included `encrypted_writer` is for demonstration only and is NOT cryptographically secure. Do not use in production.
- No built-in TLS for the `network_writer`/`log_server`. Traffic is plaintext by default.
- Authentication/authorization for the `log_server` is not implemented.

## Recommendations (Production)

1. Sanitization First
   - Enable `log_sanitizer` or wrap a `sanitizing_filter` early in your logging pipeline.
   - Add organization-specific rules (e.g., JWT, internal tokens, ticket numbers).

2. Encryption at Rest
   - Replace `encrypted_writer` with a production-ready solution based on a vetted crypto library (e.g., OpenSSL, libsodium).
   - Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).
   - Rotate keys periodically and store them in a secure vault (OS keychain, KMS, HSM). Never commit keys.

3. Encryption in Transit
   - Prefer shipping logs over a secure transport (mTLS, TLS termination at a proxy, or a syslog/OTLP exporter with TLS).
   - If extending `network_writer`, add TLS support and certificate pinning where feasible.

4. Server Hardening
   - Place `log_server` behind a reverse proxy with TLS and auth, or embed authN/Z in the server.
   - Rate-limit and validate inputs; drop malformed frames.
   - Apply least-privilege for filesystem and network permissions.

5. Data Retention and Compliance
   - Define retention windows; rotate and purge logs on schedule.
   - Anonymize or pseudonymize PII where possible.
   - Ensure compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

6. Observability
   - Use `logger_metrics` to monitor drop rates, queue utilization, and writer failures.
   - Alert on abnormal spikes in error-level logs or sanitization hits.

## Secure Configuration Checklist

- [ ] Sanitization rules enabled and customized.
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in log messages or formats.
- [ ] Transport encryption (TLS/mTLS) for any remote log shipping.
- [ ] Encryption at rest for sensitive logs, using authenticated encryption.
- [ ] Keys stored in a secure vault; rotation policy defined.
- [ ] Access control policies defined for sensitive sources and users.
- [ ] Retention and rotation configured; old logs purged securely.
- [ ] Server behind TLS/auth and with rate limits.

## Roadmap

- Optional TLS support for `network_writer`/`log_server`.
- Pluggable crypto provider interface for at-rest encryption.
- Policy-driven sanitizer configuration (YAML/JSON).
