	 * @class typed_thread_worker_t
	 * @brief A template-based worker thread class that processes jobs from a priority job queue.
	 *
	 * This class extends the functionality of \c thread_base by continually
	 * retrieving and executing jobs from a \c typed_job_queue_t. Each
	 * worker can be configured to handle specific priority levels, allowing
	 * for flexible job distribution among multiple workers.
	 *
	 * @tparam job_type
	 * A type that represents the priority levels. Often an enumeration (e.g., \c job_types).
	 * By default, it is set to \c job_types.
	 *
	 * ### Usage Example
	 * @code
	 * auto worker = std::make_shared<typed_thread_worker_t<job_types>>(
	 *     std::vector<job_types>{job_types::HIGH, job_types::MEDIUM},
	 *     true
	 * );
	 *
	 * auto queue = std::make_shared<typed_job_queue_t<job_types>>();
	 * worker->set_job_queue(queue);
	 *
	 * // Start the worker thread
	 * worker->start();
	 *
	 * // Enqueue some jobs
	 * queue->push_job(
	 *     // job lambda or functor
	 *     , job_types::HIGH
	 * );
	 ** // Stop and join the worker once done
	 *worker->stop();
	 *worker->join();
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * ### Thread Safety
	 * The worker is designed to run its own thread that continuously checks
	 * the queue for new jobs. Any shared data structures should be either
	 * thread-safe or externally synchronized.
	 *
	 * @see thread_base
	 * @see typed_job_queue_t
