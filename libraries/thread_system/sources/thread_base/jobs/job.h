	/**
	 * @class job
	 * @brief Represents a unit of work (task) to be executed, typically by a job queue.
	 *
	 * The @c job class provides a base interface for scheduling and executing discrete
	 * tasks within a multi-threaded environment. Derived classes can override the
	 * @c do_work() method to implement custom logic for their specific tasks.
	 *
	 * ### Thread-Safety
	 * - @c do_work() will generally be called from a worker thread. If your task accesses
	 *   shared data or interacts with shared resources, you must ensure your implementation
	 *   is thread-safe.
	 * - The job itself is meant to be used via @c std::shared_ptr, making it easier to
	 *   manage lifetimes across multiple threads.
	 *
	 * ### Error Handling
	 * - A job returns a @c result_void from @c do_work().
	 *   - Returning @c result_void{} indicates success.
	 *   - Returning an error indicates failure with a typed error code and message.
	 * - Error information can be used for logging, debugging, or to retry a job if desired.
	 *
	 * ### Usage Example
	 * @code
	 * // 1. Create a custom job that overrides do_work().
	 * class my_job : public thread_module::job
	 * {
	 * public:
	 *     my_job() : job("my_custom_job") {}
	 *
	 *     result_void do_work() override
	 *     {
	 *         // Execute custom logic:
	 *         bool success = perform_operation();
	 *         if (!success)
	 *             return error{error_code::job_execution_failed, "Operation failed in my_custom_job"};
	 *
	 *         return result_void{}; // success
	 *     }
	 * };
	 *
	 * // 2. Submit the job to a queue.
	 * auto q = std::make_shared<thread_module::job_queue>();
	 * auto job_ptr = std::make_shared<my_job>();
	 * q->enqueue(job_ptr);
	 * @endcode
