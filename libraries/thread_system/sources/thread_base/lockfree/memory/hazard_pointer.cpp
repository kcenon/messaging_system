/**
 * @file hazard_pointer.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of lock-free memory management using hazard pointers.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the hazard pointer system, which provides
 * safe memory reclamation for lock-free data structures. Hazard pointers prevent
 * the ABA problem by ensuring that memory is not reclaimed while other threads
 * might still be accessing it.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Thread-safe memory reclamation for lock-free structures
 * - Protection against use-after-free and ABA problems
 * - Efficient memory usage with deferred reclamation
 * - Scalable design supporting multiple threads
 * - Configurable scanning thresholds and intervals
 * 
 * Algorithm Overview:
 * 1. Threads acquire hazard pointers before accessing shared data
 * 2. Retired memory is added to thread-local retired lists
 * 3. Periodic scanning compares retired memory against active hazard pointers
 * 4. Memory not protected by hazard pointers is safely reclaimed
 * 5. Protected memory remains in retired list for later scanning
 * 
 * Performance Characteristics:
 * - O(1) hazard pointer acquisition and release
 * - O(n*m) scanning cost where n=retired nodes, m=hazard pointers
 * - Configurable memory overhead vs. reclamation latency tradeoffs
 * - Thread-local operations minimize contention
