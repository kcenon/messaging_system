/**
 * @namespace kcenon::thread
 * @brief Thread pool implementation for managing worker threads.
 *
 * The thread_pool_module namespace provides a standard thread pool implementation
 * for processing jobs concurrently using a team of worker threads.
 *
 * Key components include:
 * - thread_pool: The primary thread pool class managing multiple workers and a shared job queue
 * - thread_worker: A specialized worker thread that processes jobs from a shared queue
 * - task: A template-based convenience wrapper for creating and submitting callable jobs
 *
 * The thread pool pattern improves performance by:
 * - Reusing threads rather than creating new ones for each task
 * - Reducing thread creation overhead
 * - Limiting the total number of threads to control resource usage
 * - Providing a simple interface for async task execution
 *
 * @see kcenon::thread for a more advanced implementation with job prioritization

	/**
	 * @class thread_pool
	 * @brief A thread pool for concurrent execution of jobs using multiple worker threads.
	 *
	 * @ingroup thread_pools
	 *
	 * The @c thread_pool class manages a group of worker threads that process jobs from
	 * a shared @c job_queue. This implementation provides:
	 * - Efficient reuse of threads to reduce thread creation/destruction overhead
	 * - Controlled concurrency through a fixed or dynamic thread count
	 * - A simple interface for submitting jobs of various types
	 * - Graceful handling of thread startup, execution, and shutdown
	 *
	 * The thread pool is designed for scenarios where many short-lived tasks need to
	 * be executed asynchronously without creating a new thread for each task.
	 *
	 * ### Design Principles
	 * - **Worker Thread Model**: Each worker runs in its own thread, processing jobs
	 *   from the shared queue.
	 * - **Shared Job Queue**: A single, thread-safe queue holds all pending jobs.
	 * - **Job-Based Work Units**: Jobs encapsulate work to be executed.
	 * - **Non-Blocking Submission**: Adding jobs to the pool never blocks the caller thread.
	 * - **Cooperative Shutdown**: Workers can complete current jobs before stopping.
	 *
	 * ### Thread Safety
	 * All public methods of this class are thread-safe and can be called from any thread.
	 * The underlying @c job_queue is also thread-safe, allowing multiple workers to dequeue
	 * jobs concurrently.
	 *
	 * ### Performance Considerations
	 * - The number of worker threads should typically be close to the number of available
	 *   CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.
	 * - For I/O-bound tasks, more threads may be beneficial to maximize throughput while
	 *   some threads are blocked on I/O.
	 * - Very large thread pools (significantly more threads than cores) may degrade
	 *   performance due to context switching overhead.
	 *
	 * @see thread_worker The worker thread class used by the pool
	 * @see job_queue The shared queue for storing pending jobs
	 * @see typed_kcenon::thread::typed_thread_pool For a priority-based version
