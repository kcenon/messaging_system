 * It serves as the foundation for all thread-related functionality in the library.
 *
 * Key components include:
 * - thread_base: The fundamental worker thread class
 * - job: The base unit of work that can be scheduled and executed
 * - job_queue: A thread-safe queue for storing and retrieving jobs
 * - cancellation_token: Mechanism for cancelling ongoing operations
 *
 * This namespace implements low-level threading concepts while higher-level
 * functionality like thread pools are implemented in separate namespaces
 * that build upon these primitives.

	/**
	 * @class thread_base
	 * @brief A foundational class for implementing custom worker threads.
     * 
     * @ingroup core_threading
	 *
	 * The @c thread_base class provides a framework for managing a single worker thread,
	 * offering lifecycle methods (start, stop), optional wake intervals, and hooks
	 * (@c before_start, @c do_work, @c after_stop) for derived classes to customize behavior.
	 *
	 * This class abstracts platform-specific thread management details and provides a 
	 * unified interface for both C++20 @c std::jthread and traditional @c std::thread,
	 * selected at compile time via the @c USE_STD_JTHREAD macro.
	 *
	 * ### Key Features
	 * - Standardized thread lifecycle management (start/stop)
	 * - Thread condition monitoring
	 * - Customizable worker behavior through virtual method overrides
	 * - Optional periodic wake intervals for recurring tasks
	 * - Built-in cancellation support (via @c std::jthread or custom mechanism)
	 * - Thread-safe signaling and state management
	 *
	 * ### Thread Safety
	 * All public methods in @c thread_base are thread-safe. The class uses internal
	 * synchronization mechanisms to protect its state.
	 *
	 * ### Typical Usage
	 * 1. Inherit from @c thread_base and override @c do_work(), @c before_start(), and/or
	 *    @c after_stop() as needed.
	 * 2. Instantiate your derived class, set a wake interval if desired, then call @c start()
	 *    to launch the thread.
	 * 3. When shutting down or no longer needing the thread's work, call @c stop().
	 * 4. The thread can periodically check @c should_continue_work() or internal conditions
	 *    to determine if it should continue running.
	 *
	 * ### Example
	 * @code
	 * class my_worker : public thread_base {
	 * public:
	 *     my_worker() : thread_base("my_worker") {}
	 *
	 * protected:
	 *     result_void before_start() override {
	 *         // Initialize resources
	 *         return {};
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     result_void do_work() override {
	 *         // Perform work
	 *         return {};
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     result_void after_stop() override {
	 *         // Clean up resources
	 *         return {};
	 *     }
	 * };
	 *
	 * int main() {
	 *     auto worker = std::make_unique<my_worker>();
	 *     worker->set_wake_interval(std::chrono::milliseconds(100)); // Wake every 100ms
	 *     auto result = worker->start();
	 *     
	 *     // Do other work...
	 *     
	 *     worker->stop();
	 *     return 0;
	 * }
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * @see thread_module::job For the work unit class processed by workers
	 * @see thread_module::job_queue For the thread-safe queue used with workers
	 * @see thread_pool_module::thread_worker For a specialized worker implementation
