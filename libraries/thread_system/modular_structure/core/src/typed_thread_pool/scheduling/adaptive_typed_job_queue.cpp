/**
 * @file adaptive_typed_job_queue.cpp
 * @brief Explicit template instantiation for typed job queue with job_types enumeration.
 *
 * This file provides explicit template instantiation for the adaptive_typed_job_queue_t
 * template class and factory function with the job_types enumeration. This approach
 * separates template compilation from header inclusion, improving compilation times
 * and reducing binary size.
 * 
 * Template Instantiation Benefits:
 * - Faster compilation times for client code using typed queues
 * - Reduced binary size through single instantiation point
 * - Better error localization for template-related issues
 * - Cleaner separation between interface and implementation
 * - Improved build system dependency management
 * 
 * Instantiated Components:
 * - adaptive_typed_job_queue_t<job_types>: Main queue implementation
 * - create_typed_job_queue<job_types>: Factory function for queue creation
 * - All supported queue strategies and configurations
 * 
 * Usage Pattern:
 * - Client code includes only the header file
 * - Template implementation is pre-compiled in this unit
 * - Linker resolves template instantiation automatically
 * - Type safety maintained through template parameter validation
