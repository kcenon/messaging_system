	 * @brief Starts the worker thread and begins execution loop.
	 * 
	 * Implementation details:
	 * - First checks if thread is already running using different methods:
	 *   - C++20: stop_source_.has_value() indicates active thread
	 *   - Legacy: worker_thread_->joinable() indicates active thread
	 * - Calls stop() first to ensure clean state (idempotent operation)
	 * - Initializes stop control mechanism:
	 *   - C++20: Creates new std::stop_source for cooperative cancellation
	 *   - Legacy: Resets atomic stop_requested_ flag to false
	 * - Creates worker thread that executes the main work loop
	 * 
	 * Main Work Loop Logic:
	 * 1. Calls before_start() hook for derived class initialization
	 * 2. Enters main loop while not stopped and has work to do
	 * 3. Sets thread_condition_ to Waiting before sleep
	 * 4. Waits on condition variable with optional timeout (wake_interval)
	 * 5. Sets thread_condition_ to Working before calling do_work()
	 * 6. Calls do_work() hook for actual work execution
	 * 7. Handles exceptions from do_work() gracefully
	 * 8. Calls after_stop() hook for cleanup when exiting
	 * 
	 * Error Handling:
	 * - Returns error if thread is already running
	 * - Catches std::bad_alloc during thread creation
	 * - Logs errors from hooks using std::cerr
	 * - Exception-safe cleanup in catch blocks
	 * 
	 * @return Empty result on success, error on failure
