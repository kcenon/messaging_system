 * @file job.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of the base job class for the thread system.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of the job class, which serves as the
 * abstract base class for all work units in the thread system. The job class
 * provides essential functionality including:
 * - Job identification and naming
 * - Binary data storage for data-processing jobs
 * - Cancellation token support for cooperative cancellation
 * - Job queue association for scheduling
 * - Standard interface for work execution
 * 
 * Design Principles:
 * - Abstract base class requiring derived classes to implement do_work()
 * - Support for both simple and data-driven job types
 * - Thread-safe access to job properties
 * - Efficient memory management through RAII
 * - Flexible cancellation mechanism

	 * - Job queue is not associated initially (weak_ptr is empty)

	 * - Enables cooperative cancellation (job checks token periodically)
	 * - Thread-safe assignment (cancellation_token is thread-safe)
	 * - Token can be checked during long-running operations
	 * 
	 * Cancellation Model:
	 * - Cooperative: job must check token voluntarily
	 * - Non-preemptive: job won't be forcibly stopped
	 * - Graceful: allows cleanup before termination
	 * 
	 * Usage Pattern:
	 * 1. Create cancellation_token
	 * 2. Set token on jobs before submission
	 * 3. Job checks token during execution
	 * 4. External code can signal cancellation
