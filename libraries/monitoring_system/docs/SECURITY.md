## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Monitoring System team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you may find.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email to:

üìß **Security Contact**: kcenon@naver.com

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, compilers
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have had time to update

### Disclosure Process

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with you on timing of public disclosure
5. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit for responsible disclosure

## Security Considerations

### Architecture Security

#### Data Protection
- **Metric Data**: Metric data may contain sensitive information about system performance
- **Configuration**: Configuration files may contain sensitive connection details
- **Logs**: Log files may contain sensitive debugging information
- **Web Dashboard**: Dashboard may expose sensitive system metrics

#### Network Security
- **API Endpoints**: REST API endpoints should be protected with authentication
- **WebSocket Connections**: Real-time connections should use secure protocols
- **Data Transmission**: All network traffic should be encrypted in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS appropriately for web dashboard access

#### Access Control
- **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication for web dashboard and API
- **Authorization**: Use role-based access control for different metric categories
- **API Keys**: Rotate API keys regularly and use strong key generation
- **Session Management**: Implement secure session management for web interface

### Deployment Security

#### Configuration Security
```yaml
# Example secure configuration
monitoring:
  api:
    authentication:
      enabled: true
      api_key: "${MONITORING_API_KEY}"  # Use environment variables
    tls:
      enabled: true
      cert_file: "/path/to/cert.pem"
      key_file: "/path/to/key.pem"
  dashboard:
    cors:
      allowed_origins: ["https://trusted-domain.com"]
      credentials: true
```

#### Runtime Security
- **Process Isolation**: Run monitoring system with minimal required privileges
- **File Permissions**: Restrict file permissions for configuration and data files
- **Network Segmentation**: Deploy in appropriate network segments
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate resource limits to prevent DoS

### Code Security

#### Input Validation
- All metric names and values are validated before processing
- Configuration input is sanitized and validated
- Web API input is properly validated and escaped
- File paths are validated to prevent path traversal attacks

#### Memory Safety
- Modern C++20 features used for memory safety
- RAII principles followed consistently
- Smart pointers used for automatic memory management
- Buffer overflows prevented through bounds checking

#### Thread Safety
- All shared data structures are properly synchronized
- Lock-free data structures used where appropriate
- Race conditions prevented through careful design
- Deadlock prevention through lock ordering

### Known Security Considerations

#### Metric Data Exposure
- **Risk**: Metrics may reveal sensitive system information
- **Mitigation**: Use metric filtering and access controls
- **Best Practice**: Regularly review which metrics are being collected

#### Dashboard Access
- **Risk**: Web dashboard may expose sensitive monitoring data
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication and HTTPS
- **Best Practice**: Use network-level access controls

#### Configuration Files
- **Risk**: Configuration files may contain sensitive credentials
- **Mitigation**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Best Practice**: Restrict file permissions (600 or 640)

#### Log Files
- **Risk**: Log files may contain sensitive debugging information
- **Mitigation**: Configure appropriate log levels for production
- **Best Practice**: Implement log rotation and secure log storage

## Security Hardening Guide

### Production Deployment

1. **Enable Authentication**:
```cpp
// Configure API authentication
monitoring_config.api.authentication.enabled = true;
monitoring_config.api.authentication.api_key = get_secure_api_key();
```

2. **Use HTTPS/TLS**:
```cpp
// Enable TLS for web dashboard
monitoring_config.dashboard.tls.enabled = true;
monitoring_config.dashboard.tls.cert_file = "/path/to/cert.pem";
monitoring_config.dashboard.tls.key_file = "/path/to/key.pem";
```

3. **Configure CORS Properly**:
```cpp
// Restrict CORS to trusted origins
monitoring_config.dashboard.cors.allowed_origins = {
    "https://monitoring.yourcompany.com"
};
```

4. **Implement Access Controls**:
```cpp
// Set up role-based access
monitoring_config.access_control.enabled = true;
monitoring_config.access_control.roles = {
    {"admin", {"read", "write", "configure"}},
    {"operator", {"read", "write"}},
    {"viewer", {"read"}}
};
```
